About Project:

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the latest term for steatotic liver disease associated with metabolic syndrome. MASLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and is the leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. 
We provided here an analysis of Metabolites observation for MASLD Progression. 

MASLD Development from normal liver :

The exogenous lipoprotein pathway starts with the incorporation of dietary lipids into chylomicrons in the intestine. Chylomicron triglycerides are metabolized in muscle and adipose tissue and chylomicron remnants are formed, which are removed by the liver. The endogenous lipoprotein pathway begins in the liver with the formation of very low-density lipoprotein particles (VLDL). VLDL triglycerides are metabolized in muscle and adipose tissue forming intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), which may be taken up by the liver or further metabolized to low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Reverse cholesterol transport begins with the formation of nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by the liver and intestine that acquire cholesterol from cells resulting in mature HDL. The HDL then transports the cholesterol to the liver either directly or indirectly by transferring the cholesterol to VLDL or LDL.

VLDL synthesis is the vivid point of observation for Metabolites focus for MASLD development including sub metabolites concentration as an inhibiting factor.
